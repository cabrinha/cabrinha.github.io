title: The Tripping Octo Robot
---

From Linux to OS X and back again! You'd think a title like that would
hold the promise of an exciting blog post. I'll let you be the judge of
that.

## Linux

I started using Linux around 2010 when 
[Cyanogenmod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/) was developing version 
5.0.8. I got my first Android phone, the HTC Incredible, and realized
that all the "cool" kids were rooting their devices. The next step
after rooting your Android was to install a custom ROM. The best ROMs
were few and far between. You were either on Bugless Beast or
Cyanogenmod.

## Ricing

Meaning: Making improvements to a system that don't actually do anyone
any good, and can sometimes have negative ramifications.
