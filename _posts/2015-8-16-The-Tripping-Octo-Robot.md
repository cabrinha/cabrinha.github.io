title: The Tripping Octo Robot

From Linux to OS X and back again! You'd think a title like that would hold the promise of an exciting blog post. I'll let you be the judge of that.

## Linux

I started using Linux around 2010 when [Cyanogenmod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/)
was developing version 5.0.8. I got my first Android phone, the HTC Incredible,
and realized that all the "cool" kids were rooting their devices.

## Ricing

Meaning: Making improvements to a system that don't actually do anyone
any good, and can sometimes have negative ramifications.
