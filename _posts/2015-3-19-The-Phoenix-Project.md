### A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win

It is rare for me to read an entire book over the course of a week. I usually take months to get around to cracking open a good ol' paperback and taking the time away from some kind of screen to sit down and enjoy a novel. *I don't typically read novels.* But, with this book, it was all too easy. A friend of mine, [James Loosli](http://http://jamesloos.li/), recommended this book to me. He said it would change the way I looked at IT and business and it did.

The book was easy-to-read and upbeat, if not fast paced. The authors never get into the really technical nitty-gritty of IT things, but they do a good job of giving you the overall gist of any one of the hundreds of situations our protagonist is faced with. Even if you're not an *IT person* you're still going to be able to cruise through the book with a good understanding of what's going on.

This book covers:

* **"The Three Ways"**, which you can read about [here](http://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/) and [here](https://infotechfb.com/blog/the-three-ways-of-devops/). 
* **[Agile Methodology](http://agilemethodology.org/)**
* **The Four Types of Work**

I couldn't find a link for the explanation of *"The Four Types of Work"* and I won't elaborate on them because an important part of the book is guessing what they could be and figuring it out for yourself.

Overall, this book does a great job of bridging the gap between business and IT. You would never think of associating IT work with the workflow of a manufacturing plant, but after reading this, it makes a lot of sense.

10/10 would recommend.
