### A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win

It is rare for me to read an entire book over the course of a week. I usually take months to get around to cracking open a good ol' paperback and taking the time away from some kind of screen to sit down and enjoy a novel. *I don't typically read novels.* But, with this book, it was all too easy. A friend of mine, [James Loosli](http://http://jamesloos.li/), recommended this book to me. He said it would change the way I looked at IT and business and it did.

The book was easy-to-read and upbeat, if not fast paced. The authors never get into the really technical nitty-gritty of IT things, but they do a good job of giving you the overall gist of any one of the hundreds of situations our protagonist is faced with. Even if you're not an *IT person* you're still going to be able to cruise through the book with a good understanding of what's going on. 

This book covers:

* **"The Three Ways"**, which you can read about [here](http://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/) and [here](https://infotechfb.com/blog/the-three-ways-of-devops/). 
* **[Agile Methodology](http://agilemethodology.org/)**
* **The Four Types of Work**

I couldn't find a link for the explanation of *"The Four Types of Work"* and I won't elaborate on them because it's an important part of the book, guessing what they could be. 

Overall, this book is great. You would never think of associating IT work with the workflow of a manufacturing plant, but it makes a lot of sense.

10/10 would recommend.
