## Welcome to Silicon Valley

About 6 months ago I talked about moving back to California.
I've been living in Silicon Valley since January and I like it here.
It's been raining quite a bit, which is a little out of the ordinary but well received.
This area is a major shift from San Antonio. It's just a different vibe up here.

It's another world.

Tech giants sit right across the street from one another. Nearly everyone my age is developing 
the next big app or landing rockets on floating platforms in the middle of the ocean.
Most people up here tend to value equity more than their salary. Which make some sense, 
considering that the value of that equity is susceptible to increasing over time whereas inflation 
dictates that the value of your fixed salary will only decline.

Everyone wants to work for a startup. Uber is about to go public, supposedly, and everyone 
wants to get those pre-IPO stock options. Tech workers dream of escaping the rigorous throws 
of corporate bureaucracy in favor of a creative, interesting, small-but-powerful untamed startup.

There are a lot of Teslas up here. Prius is runner up of most popular car on the road. 
If you ever get a chance to watch HBO's "Silicon Valley", there is very little difference 
between the show and the reality of this area.

"Incubators" aka "Hacker Houses" are a real thing. I'm technically living in one of them. 
My roomates work at Apple, Google and Intel. One is a Quantum Computing Mathemetician, or at 
least, that's what he tells everyone.

### Working Graveyard for a Living

Internet technologies are becoming more and more expected to be and stay "Always-On". What 
this means from an infrastructure point of view is reliability. Uptime is a, if not *the* 
measure of performance.

I work the night shift at an Internet of Things company. This means while everyone is asleep, 
I'm online, hard at work monitoring thousands of Linux servers for inconsistencies, 
searching for ripples in cyberspace, deploying code and yes, even writing some small scripts. 
Never having worked a night shift position before, it has been difficult to adjust my eating 
and sleeping schedules. Essentially I live a backwards life, heading into the office around 
10pm every weeknight, taking lunch around 2am and heading home by 7am to catch some Z's by 9am.

I'm learning a lot and doing what I love so, how bad can it be, really?

## Where in the World is Satashi Nakamoto?

What I really want to talk about... What's been holding my interest with laser focus for the 
past couple weeks, is all the "Satoshi Nakamoto" news that's coming out.

I've been interested in Bitcoin since 2011. I've been evangelizing the technology and speculating 
in the market since 2013. I've day traded, converted non-believers and kept an ear to the ground. 
If you're interested in learning more about Bitcoin, there are plenty of [resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) online.

### 0.00000001

Dr. Craig Steven Wright has publicly claimed to be the creator of Bitcoin. Gavin Andresen 
publicly backed that claim (and subsequently had his github commit access to the Bitcoin 
open-source project removed). JVP has also publicly backed Wright's claim, but wait, there's 
more!

BBC landed [the interview](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36168863), with [The Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/craig-wright-claims-he-is-bitcoin-inventor-satoshi-nakamoto-1462182349), [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/business/dealbook/bitcoin-craig-wright-satoshi-nakamoto.html), [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/craig-wright-privately-proved-hes-bitcoins-creator/) 
and others having published stories just after, confirming Wright's claims. Then redacting them, 
then publishing follow up articles asking ["Is he really?"](http://www.economist.com/news/briefings/21698061-craig-steven-wright-claims-be-satoshi-nakamoto-bitcoin). There is so much more to the complete 
story than can fit in a single news article and I believe that story is far from over.

This is the type of rabbit hole you can never leave.

All the news coming out seems to be an advanced lesson in slight of hand and an extreme 
demonstration of misdirection. And we haven't even gotten to [David Kleiman](http://gizmodo.com/the-strange-life-and-death-of-dave-kleiman-a-computer-1747092460) yet. 
I don't have the energy to lay out a play-by-play timeline of everything that has transpired over the past two weeks, 
but if you have the interest, I'm sure you'll be able to find what you're looking for.
