title: Welcome to the Valley
---

About 6 months ago I talked about moving back to California.
I've been living in Silicon Valley since January and I like it here.
It's been raining quite a bit, which is a little out of the ordinary but well received.
This area is a major shift from San Antonio. It's just a different vibe up here.
<!--more-->
It's another world.

Tech giants sit right across the street from one another. Nearly everyone my age is developing 
the next big app or [landing rockets on floating platforms in the middle of the ocean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPGUQySBikQ
).
Most people up here tend to value equity in the company they work for more than their salary. 
Which make sense but, it's usually unheard of for regular employees at smaller companies to 
be granted any amount of stock options with their compensation.

If you ever get a chance to watch HBO's "Silicon Valley", there is very little difference 
between the show and the reality of this area.

[Tech incubators](http://www.inc.com/john-rampton/top-10-hot-incubators-to-join-in-silicon-valley.html) 
aka [Hacker Houses](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/roo?query=hacker) are a real thing. 
Everyone up here is an "Engineer". Software, Hardware, Infrastructure. There are far more 
women working as Software Developers up here than I thought there would be. Which is 
refreshing.

[Au Pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Au_pair) are quite common as well. 
Stand around the keg at any backyard party in the Valley for more than ten minutes and 
you're likely to hear some German being spoken. There are people from all over the world here 
and it's enlightening to hear about the various backgrounds and origins that this melting pot 
of technology has stirred together.

## Rising from the Grave

Internet technologies are expected to be and remain "Always-On". What this means from a 
human resources standpoint is man hours. Uptime is a, if not *the*, measure of worth for any 
online service, mobile app or popular website.

I work the night shift at an [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things) 
company. This means while everyone else is asleep, I'm online, hard at work monitoring 
tens of thousands of Linux servers for anomolies, cruising through cyberspace, deploying 
code and yes, even writing some small scripts myself. Never having worked a night shift 
position before, it has been difficult to adjust my schedule. 

I'm learning a lot and doing what I love so, how bad can it be, really?

## Technical Debt

I've been acquiring my fair share of geek gear lately. I blame [head-fi.org](https://head-fi.org) and [/r/mechanicalkeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) for this.

### Click Klack!

First up, the Happy Hacking Professional 2:

A very compact keyboard layout without windows or arrow keys. Designed specifically with UNIX 
users in mind. I really loved the look and feel of this keyboard, but I couldn't get used to 
the positioning of the tilde `~` and pipe `|` keys. Whenever I wanted to use the arrow keys, 
I found myself contorting my hand into uncomfortable positions. Thus, after only two weeks on 
my desk, the keyboard found a new home by route of [/r/mechmarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/).

Introducing the Leopold FC660C:

This keyboard is slightly bigger than the HHKB, much heavier yet seemingly better build 
quality. It's my current daily driver at work. Topre for life!

### Can you hear me now?

Music has always been passion of mine. Listening to music while I'm on the computer is a 
ritual and it was about time I made a sound investment in audio gear.

MrSpeakers Mad Dog Headphones:
![MadDog](https://mrspeakers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MDP-34-view-1280x1280.jpg)

These closed-back [planar magnetic headphones](http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/how-planar-magnetic-headphones-work) 
are just plain awesome. Not too expensive and not too weak to be completely immersed in 
any genre of music. They're easily the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned and 
I'm lucky to have snagged a pair before they were [discontinued](http://www.head-fi.org/t/766668/end-of-life-and-sale-on-mad-dog-and-alpha-headphones). 
A comprehensive review can be found on [head-fi](http://www.head-fi.org/products/mrspeakers-mad-dog-t50rp-mod).

Of course, with all that high-end headphone goodness, you need an AMP/DAC to power it.

Hi, ifi Micro iDSD:

This thing looks and [sounds gorgeous](http://www.head-fi.org/products/ifi-audio-micro-idsd), in my opinion.

Finally, we have another pair of closed-back Fostex cans, the Massdrop X Fostex TH-X00:
![TH-X00](https://massdrop-s3.imgix.net/product-images/fostex-x-massdrop-th-x00/MD-9475_20151120171104_e7722094d1248da0.jpg)

These headphones are a collaboration between [Fostex](https://www.fostex.com/) and [Massrop](https://massdrop.com/). They're also made of rich mahogany. 
Overall, I've collected some good gear recently and can't see myself justifying any more purchases of this nature for quite some time.
