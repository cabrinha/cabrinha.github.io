title: Satoshi is as Satoshi Does

# Where in the World is Satashi Nakamoto?

What I really want to talk about... What's been holding my attention with laser focus for the 
last couple weeks, is all this "Satoshi Nakamoto" news that's coming out.

I've been interested in Bitcoin since 2011. I've been evangelizing the technology and speculating 
in the market since 2013. I've day traded, converted non-believers and kept an ear to the ground. 
If you're interested in learning more about Bitcoin, there are plenty of [resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) online.

[Dr. Craig Steven Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Steven_Wright) has publicly 
claimed to be the creator of Bitcoin. [Gavin Andresen](https://twitter.com/gavinandresen) publicly [backed that claim](http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi) 
(then consequently had his github commit permissions to the Bitcoin open-source project 
[removed](https://twitter.com/petertoddbtc/status/727078284345917441)). [JVP](https://twitter.com/haq4good) has also publicly backed Wright's claim, but 
wait, there's [more](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/satoshi-saga-continues-tulip-trust-trustee-expected-to-appear-by-september-says-joseph-vaughnperling-1462467803)!

BBC landed [the interview](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36168863), with [The Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/craig-wright-claims-he-is-bitcoin-inventor-satoshi-nakamoto-1462182349), [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/business/dealbook/bitcoin-craig-wright-satoshi-nakamoto.html), [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/craig-wright-privately-proved-hes-bitcoins-creator/) 
and [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21698060-craig-wright-reveals-himself-as-satoshi-nakamoto) having published stories just after, confirming Wright's claims. 
Then redacting them, then publishing follow up articles asking 
["Is he really?"](http://www.economist.com/news/briefings/21698061-craig-steven-wright-claims-be-satoshi-nakamoto-bitcoin). 
There is so much more to the complete story than can fit in a single news article and 
I believe that story is far from over. His claim was quickly debunked 
by [reddit users everywhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4hf4ku/bitcoins_elusive_founder_reveals_himself_as/d2pj2pe). 

[Vitalik](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin) also [wrecked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qLI3VIHuKU) Gavin at 
[Consensus 2016](http://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2016/) on why he thinks it's not CSW.

All the "proof" offered so far seems to be an advanced lesson in [slight of hand](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hhreq/how_craig_constructed_the_message_that_he_signed/)
and an extreme [demonstration of misdirection](http://imgur.com/IPDPXZm). And we haven't 
even got to [David Kleiman](http://gizmodo.com/the-strange-life-and-death-of-dave-kleiman-a-computer-1747092460) 
yet. Nor have I even mentioned the [Tulip Trading Trust](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2644014/Tulip-Trust-Redacted.pdf)...

Craig is also under audit by the Australian Tax Office and [some claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hm5l1/telling_craig_wright_deflected_question_about/) 
his shoddy public reveal to be motivated by tax evasion purposes.

Still, the rabbit hole goes even [deeper](https://twitter.com/BitcoinBelle/status/728355416846045189).

Some people say, "It doesn't matter who Satoshi is!" and I disagree, simply because 
I want to know. However, the world may never know.
