#### Yeah, about all this... 

Well, these days, everyone has a blog. So, why not me? I'd like this blog to serve as an archive of my thoughts as well as a place to document my progress in work and life. Ever since I was introduced to social media, I've asked myself the question: How much is too much? This blog will mainly serve as a reference for myself. I'd like to use it as a filing cabinet of tips and tricks, meditations and reflections.

I set this blog up with the help of:

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
* [Poole](http://getpoole.com)

and ... of course

* [GitHub](https://github.com)
